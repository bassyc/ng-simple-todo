    AngularJS apps are formed from one or more modules. Modules are
    created by calling the angular.module method, as follows:

        var todoApp = angular.module("todoApp", []);

    The arguments to the angular.module method are:

        1. the name of the module to create and
        2. an array of other modules that are going to be needed.Please note the
           dependencies argument must be supplied, avoiding which causes an error.
           If there are no dependencies then provide an empty array.

    Tell AngularJS to apply the module through the ng-app attribute(in AngularJS
    terms it is referred as a DIRECTIVE)

    The most important AngularJS addition to HTML is the ng-app attribute,
    which specifies that the html element in the listing contains a module that
    should be processed by AngularJS.

    When AngularJS is the only JavaScript framework being used, the convention
    is to apply the ng-app attribute to the html element, as shown below.
    If you are mixing AngularJS with other technologies such as jQuery, you
    can narrow the boundaries of the AngularJS app by applying the ng-app
    attribute to an element within the document.

<head>
    <title>TODO List</title>
